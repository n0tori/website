- layout
	- figure out colour scheme
	- make header more interesting

- home
	- scrolling text on top "aspiring software dev" in style of advert
	- fix gifs generating on load which looks weird and goofy (who cares really)
- posts
	- markdown renderer no worky for some stuff, see test post
	- sort posts by date and filter by tags
		- overkill probably
- sections
	- for links
		- name it: "Selections", "Nexus"?, "Collectanea", "Adversaria"
	- for projects

- extra
	- seasonal themes to website at times of calendar festivities
