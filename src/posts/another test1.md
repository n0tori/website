when high school enrollments increased greatly within a relatively short
period, educators began to realize that it could no longer be assumed
that entering students could read effectively. Remedial reading
instruction was therefore provided, sometimes for as many as 75% or
more students. Within the last decade, the same situation has occurred
at the college level. Thus, of approximately 40,000 freshmen entering
the City University of New York in the fall of 1971, upwards of half, or
more than 20,000 young people, had to be given some kind of remedial
training in reading.
That does not mean, however, that reading instruction beyond the
elementary level is offered in many U.S. colleges to this day. In fact, it is
offered in almost none of them. Remedial reading instruction is not
instruction in the higher levels of reading. It serves only to bring
students up to a level of maturity in reading that they should have
attained by the time they graduated from elementary school. To this
day, most institutions of higher learning either do not know how to
instruct students in reading beyond the elementary level, or lack the
facilities and personnel to do so.
We say this despite the fact that a number of four-year and
community colleges have recently instituted courses in speed reading,
or in “effective” reading, or “competence” in reading. On the whole
(though there are exceptions), these courses are remedial. They are
designed to overcome various kinds of failures of the lower schools.
They are not designed to take the student beyond the first level or to
introduce him to the kinds and levels of reading that are the main
subject of this book.
This, of course, should not be the case. A good liberal arts high
school, if it does nothing else, ought to produce graduates who are
competent analytical readers. A good college, if it does nothing else,
ought to produce competent syntopical readers. A college degree ought
to represent general competence in reading such that a graduate could
read any kind of material for general readers and be able to undertake
independent research on almost any subject (for that is what syntopical
reading, among other things, enables you to do). Often, however, three
or four years of graduate study are required before students attain this
level of reading ability, and they do not always attain it even then.
One should not have to spend four years in graduate school in order
to learn how to read. Four years of graduate school, in addition to
twelve years of preparatory education and four years of college—that
adds up to twenty full years of schooling. It should not take that long to
learn to read. Something is very wrong if it does.
What is wrong can be corrected. Courses could be instituted in many
high schools and colleges that are based on the program described in
this book. There is nothing arcane or even really new about what we
have to propose. It is largely common sense.
Reading and the Democratic Ideal of Education
We do not want to seem to be mere carping critics. We know that the
thunder of thousands of freshmen feet upon the stairs makes it hard to
hear, no matter how reasonable the message. And as long as a large
proportion, even a majority, of these new students cannot read
effectively at the elementary level, we are aware that the first task to be
faced must be to teach them to read in the lowest, the largest common-
denominator, sense of the term.
Nor, for the moment, would we want it any other way. We are on
record as holding that unlimited educational opportunity—or, speaking
practically, educational opportunity that is limited only by individual
desire, ability, and need—is the most valuable service that society can
provide for its members. That we do not yet know how to provide that
kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.
But we must also realize—students, teachers, and laymen alike—that
even when we have accomplished the task that lies before us, we will
not have accomplished the whole task. We must be more than a nation
of functional literates. We must become a nation of truly competent
readers, recognizing all that the word competent implies. Nothing less
will satisfy the needs of the world that is coming.

THE SECOND LEVEL OF READING: INSPECTIONAL
READING
Inspectional reading is a true level of reading. It is quite distinct from
the level that precedes it (elementary reading) and from the one that
follows it in natural sequence (analytical reading). But, as we noted in
Chapter 2, the levels of reading are cumulative. Thus, elementary
reading is contained in inspectional reading, as, indeed, inspectional
reading is contained in analytical reading, and analytical reading in
syntopical reading.
Practically, this means that you cannot read on the inspectional level
unless you can read effectively on the elementary level. You must be
able to read an author’s text more or less steadily, w
