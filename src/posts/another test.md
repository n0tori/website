Every book has a skeleton hidden between its covers. Your job as an
analytical reader is to find it.
A book comes to you with flesh on its bare bones and clothes over its
flesh. It is all dressed up. You do not have to undress it or tear the flesh
off its limbs to get at the firm structure that underlies the soft surface.
But you must read the book with X-ray eyes, for it is an essential part of
your apprehension of any book to grasp its structure.
Recognition of the need to see the structure of a book leads to the
discovery of the second and third rules for reading any book. We say
“any book.” These rules apply to poetry as well as to science, and to any
kind of expository work. Their application will be different, of course,
according to the kind of book they are used on. The unity of a novel is
not the same as the unity of a treatise on politics; nor are the parts of
the same sort, or ordered in the same way. But every book without
exception that is worth reading at all has a unity and an organization of
parts. A book that did not would be a mess. It would be relatively
unreadable, as bad books actually are.
We will state these two rules as simply as possible. Then we will
explain and illustrate them.
The second rule of analytical reading can be expressed as follows:
RULE 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT
MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH).
This means that you must say what the whole book is about as
briefly as possible. To say what the whole book is about is not the same
as saying what kind of book it is. (That was covered by Rule 1.) The
word “about” may be misleading here. In one sense, a book is about a
certain type of subject matter, which it treats in a certain way. If you
know this, you know what kind of book it is. But there is another, more
colloquial sense of “about.” We ask a person what he is about, what he
is up to. So we can wonder what an author is up to, what he is trying to
do. To find out what a book is about in this sense is to discover its theme
or main point.
A book is a work of art. (Again, we want to warn you against too
narrow a conception of “art.” We do not mean, or we do not only mean,
“fine art” here. A book is the product of someone who has a certain skill
in making. He is a maker of books and he has made one here for our
benefit.) In proportion as it is good, as a book and as a work of art, it
has a more nearly perfect, a more pervasive unity. This is true of music
and paintings, of novels and plays; it is no less true of books that convey
knowledge.
But it is not enough to acknowledge this fact vaguely. You must
apprehend the unity with definiteness. There is only one way to know
that you have succeeded. You must be able to tell yourself or anybody
else what the unity is, and in a few words. (If it requires too many
words, you have not seen the unity but a multiplicity.) Do not be
satisfied with “feeling the unity” that you cannot express. The reader
who says, “I know what it is, but I just can’t say it,” probably does not
even fool himself.
The third rule can be expressed as follows: R
